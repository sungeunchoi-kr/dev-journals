# Fix the Logic AU Validation Error -- Class Data fields do not match component description

Using [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) to make [Muse](https://www.musesessions.co) audio plugins, the AU plugin validation was failing with the error message:

```
VERIFYING CLASS INFO
ERROR: Class Data fields aufx, tPsV, Muse do not match component description

WARNING: Preset name is not retained in retrieved class data

TESTING HOST CALLBACKS
    PASS

* * FAIL
```

I had used the `python duplicate.py IPlugEffect {{MyNewPlugin}} {{MyManufacturerName}}` to create the initial iPlug2 boilerplate project ([reference](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/wiki/01_Getting_started_mac_ios)). Well the initial sample project has the manufacturer name set as "Acme", and it was scrattered throughout the code even on the destination project. I manually replaced all the instances of "Acme" into "Muse" and the validation error was fixed.

Useful commands:
  - `auval -a` - List the AU plugins currently on the system.
  - `auval -v aufx tPsV Muse` - **v**alidate the plugin specified.

The id "tPsV" is a random id generated by the iPlug2's `duplicate.py` script.
